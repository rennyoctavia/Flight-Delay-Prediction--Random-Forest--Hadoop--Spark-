# Flight-Delay-Prediction--Random-Forest--Hadoop--Spark-
DAT500 - Data Intensive System (Group Project)

Flight delay prediction is a good model for both airlines commercial players and customer to give insights for better planning and handling, which can potentially lead to cost savings. As the flight data is massive, we implemented random forest algorithm using distributed system such as hadoop and spark framework. Random forest is well known as a robust algorithm which is stable and less prone to overfitting, and also it is naturally support paralellism as it is an ensemble of decision trees that can be build independently of each other in parallel. By combining these characteristic with implementation on Hadoop or Spark framework, it can be a powerful tool for this task.
